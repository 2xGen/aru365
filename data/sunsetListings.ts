      { question: "What is the best sunset cruise in Aruba with open bar?", answer: "The Dolphin catamaran sunset cruise is one of Aruba's top open-bar sunset sails. It includes unlimited drinks, snacks, and a 2–3 hour cruise along the coast during the golden hour. Delphi Watersports departs from in front of the Hyatt Regency on Palm Beach. Many travelers choose it for the lively atmosphere and proven value." },
      { question: "What time do sunset cruises leave in Aruba?", answer: "Sunset cruises in Aruba typically depart 1–2 hours before sunset so you're on the water for the golden hour. Exact times vary by season (sunset is around 6–6:30 PM in summer, earlier in winter). The Dolphin sunset cruise departure time will be on your confirmation—arrive 15–20 minutes early for check-in." },
      { question: "Is the Dolphin sunset cruise good for couples in Aruba?", answer: "Yes. The Dolphin sunset cruise works well for couples: open bar, snacks, spacious deck, and a relaxed sail into the golden hour. It's also popular with groups, so the vibe is social but not overly rowdy. For a more intimate or romantic option, consider Palm Pleasure or the seaside dinner cruise." },
      { question: "Where do sunset cruises depart from in Aruba?", answer: "The Dolphin sunset cruise departs from Delphi Watersports, located in front of the Hyatt Regency towel hut on Palm Beach. Most Aruba sunset cruises leave from Palm Beach marinas, Noord, or nearby piers. Your booking confirmation will include the exact meeting point and check-in time." },
      { question: "Do I need to book a sunset cruise in Aruba in advance?", answer: "Yes. Popular sunset cruises like the Dolphin sell out, especially in high season (December–April). Booking a few days ahead secures your spot and often locks in better prices. Many operators offer free cancellation when you book in advance—check the booking page for the latest policy." },

      { question: "Sunset cruise or dinner cruise in Aruba—which is better?", answer: "It depends. A sunset cruise with snacks and open bar (like the Dolphin or Arusun) is shorter and more casual. A dinner cruise (like Red Sail's buffet on board or Pelican's seaside dinner) adds a full meal—better for anniversaries or if you want dinner included. Pelican's seaside dinner option gives you both sailing and a proper meal ashore." },
      { question: "What is included in a sunset dinner cruise in Aruba?", answer: "Pelican's sunset cruise and seaside dinner includes the sunset sail (drinks on board), then a full seaside dinner with drinks at a waterfront venue.

      { question: "How long is a sunset cruise with dinner in Aruba?", answer: "The full experience—sunset sail plus seaside dinner—typically runs 3–4 hours or more. You'll sail for about 1–2 hours, then dine at the seaside venue. Check the booking page for exact duration and timing." },

It's more refined than party-style sunset cruises—cocktails, sunset views, and table service in one sail." },

Octopus's Happy Hour sunset sail includes an unlimited cocktail bar with drinks served to your seat—spirits, cocktails, and non-alcoholic options. Other Aruba sunset cruises with open bar include the Dolphin, Red Sail's sunset catamaran, Jolly Pirates, and the Arusun." },
      { question: "What should I wear on a sunset cruise in Aruba?", answer: "Wear casual, comfortable clothes—shorts, sundress, or light pants. Bring a light layer; it can get breezy on the water after sunset. Soft-soled shoes or sandals work best. Swimwear is optional since most sunset sails don't include swimming. Avoid heels on deck." },
      { question: "How much does a sunset cruise cost in Aruba?", answer: "Sunset cruises in Aruba typically range from about $50–$120 per person. The Happy Hour sail with Octopus is mid-range—you pay for the cushioned seating and table service. Cheaper options (Arusun, Dolphin) offer open bar and snacks; pricier ones add dinner. Prices vary by season and operator." },
      { question: "What is the best time of year for a sunset cruise in Aruba?", answer: "Aruba's dry season (December–April) offers the most reliable weather and clearest skies for sunset. Year-round, Aruba rarely gets rain, so sunset cruises run almost every day. Book a few days ahead in high season; sunset times shift slightly by season (around 6–6:30 PM in summer)." },

      { question: "What Pelican Aruba sunset cruises are available?", answer: "Pelican Aruba offers several: the Sunset Sail Experience (simple sail + drinks), the Havanas Sunset Cruise (sail on the Havanas vessel + open bar), and the Sunset Cruise and Seaside Dinner (sail + dinner onshore). The Havanas and Sunset Sail are drinks-only; the Seaside Dinner includes a full meal." },
      { question: "Havanas vs Sunset Sail Experience in Aruba—what's the difference?", answer: "Both are Pelican sunset cruises with open bar and no dinner. The difference is the vessel: the Havanas cruise uses the Havanas boat; the Sunset Sail Experience may use a different Pelican vessel. Functionally similar—sailing and drinks. Choose based on which boat or time slot works for you." },
      { question: "What boat does Pelican Aruba use for sunset cruises?", answer: "Pelican Aruba operates multiple vessels: the Havanas (for the Havanas sunset cruise), teak schooners, and catamarans. The exact boat for each sunset sail depends on the tour and schedule. Your confirmation will specify the vessel. All offer comfortable sailing and open bar." },
      { question: "Is the Havanas sunset cruise good for couples?", answer: "Yes. The Havanas cruise offers a relaxed sail with drinks—no dinner, no party vibe. Good for couples who want a simple sunset experience. For a more romantic or special-occasion evening, Pelican's seaside dinner (sail + meal) may be a better fit. The Havanas is straightforward and reliable." },
      { question: "Can I book a Pelican sunset cruise last minute in Aruba?", answer: "Sometimes, but advance booking is recommended. Pelican's sunset cruises can sell out in high season. Booking a few days ahead secures your spot. Check the cancellation policy—many tours offer free cancellation when booked in advance, so you can reserve early without commitment." },

      { question: "What is the cheapest sunset cruise in Aruba?", answer: "The Arusun sunset sail is often one of the most affordable options: about 2–2.5 hours, open bar, snacks, and a 65-foot catamaran. It's the same boat used for daytime snorkel sails—proven value. For comparison, dinner cruises and premium sails (Octopus, seaside dinner) cost more. Check current prices on the booking page." },
      { question: "Is the Arusun catamaran good for sunset cruises?", answer: "Yes. The Arusun runs both daytime snorkel sails and sunset cruises—same 65-foot catamaran, high reviews, open bar, and snacks. The sunset cruise is shorter (2–2.5 hours) and focused on the golden hour. Ideal if you want a compact, well-priced sunset sail without a long evening commitment." },
      { question: "Arusun daytime vs sunset sail—which should I book?", answer: "Daytime sail: snorkeling at the Antilla wreck and Boca Catalina, open bar, 2.5 hours. Sunset sail: no snorkeling, open bar, golden hour, 2–2.5 hours. Choose daytime for snorkeling and action; choose sunset for an evening sail and photos. Both use the same catamaran and operator." },
      { question: "What is included on the Arusun sunset sail?", answer: "The Arusun sunset cruise includes a 65-foot catamaran sail, unlimited open bar (spirits, cocktails, sodas, water), and snacks. No dinner—you're back in time to eat ashore. Marine nets, shaded seating, and a relaxed vibe. Operated by Aruba Watersports Center." },
      { question: "Where does the Arusun catamaran depart in Aruba?", answer: "Aruba Watersports Center operates the Arusun from a pier in Aruba. You may take a short zodiac ride from the pier to the catamaran. Your confirmation will include the exact meeting point, check-in time, and any parking or taxi instructions. Typically in the Palm Beach / Noord area." },
