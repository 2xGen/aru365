      { question: "What does 'videos included' mean on a snorkel tour?", answer: "The operator films your snorkel (e.g. with a GoPro) and provides you with video footage afterward. You get a souvenir of your turtle and reef experience without bringing your own camera." },
      { question: "Is the turtle snorkeling good for beginners?", answer: "Yes. The tour includes equipment and instruction, and the guide accompanies the group. The video option is especially popular with families and first-timers who want to focus on the experience rather than filming." },
      { question: "How do I get the snorkel videos?", answer: "Operators typically share the video link or file after the tour (e.g. by email or cloud link). Check the listing or confirmation for how and when you'll receive the footage." },
